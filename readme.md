## 시퀀스 다이어그램


Creating sequence diagrams with PlantUML is remarkably straightforward. This ease of use is largely attributed to the user-friendly nature of its syntax, designed to be both intuitive and easy to remember.

- **Intuitive Syntax:** 
  First and foremost, users appreciate the straightforward and intuitive syntax that PlantUML employs. This well-thought-out design means that even those new to diagram creation find it easy to grasp the basics quickly and without hassle.

- **Text-to-Graphic Correlation:** 
  Another distinguishing feature is the close resemblance between the textual representation and the graphical output. This harmonious correlation ensures that the textual drafts translate quite accurately into graphical diagrams, providing a cohesive and predictable design experience without unpleasant surprises in the final output.

- **Efficient Crafting Process:** 
  The strong correlation between the text and the graphical result not only simplifies the crafting process but also significantly speeds it up. Users benefit from a more streamlined process with fewer requirements for time-consuming revisions and adjustments.

- **Visualization While Drafting:** 
  The ability to envisage the final graphical outcome while drafting the text is a feature that many find invaluable. It naturally fosters a smooth transition from initial draft to final presentation, enhancing productivity and reducing the likelihood of errors.

- **Easy Edits and Revisions:** 
  Importantly, editing existing diagrams is a hassle-free process. Since the diagrams are generated from text, users find that making adjustments is considerably easier and more precise than altering an image using graphical tools. It boils down to simply modifying the text, a process far more straightforward and less prone to errors than making changes through a graphical interface with a mouse.

PlantUML facilitates a straightforward and user-friendly approach to creating and editing sequence diagrams, meeting the needs of both novices and seasoned designers alike. It skillfully leverages the simplicity of textual inputs to craft visually descriptive and accurate diagrams, thereby establishing itself as a must-have tool in the diagram creation toolkit.

## 기본 예제
시퀀스 ``->``는 두 참여자들 사이의 메시지를 그리기 위해 사용된다.
참여자들은 명시적으로 선언하지 않아도 된다.

점선 화살표를 만들기 위해서는 ``-->``를 사용한다.

또한 ``<-``과 ``<--``를 사용할 수 있다.
출력되는 그림은 변경되지 않지만, 가독성을 향상시키는데 사용할 수 있다.
이는 시퀀스 다이어그램에만 적용되며, 다른 다이어그램에는 다른 규칙이 적용된다.
